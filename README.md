>These features together make the backend robust, secure, and efficient

## Implemented Laravel Features

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
Laravel's clean architecture promotes SRP by dividing the application into controllers, models, and services. This ensures maintainability and scalability, making the project easy to debug and extend as new features are added.

### **2. API Resource Transformations**
Used API resources to transform data consistently before sending responses. This ensures a standardized API output, improving integration with the frontend and mobile applications.

### **3. Middleware for Authentication and Authorization**
Implemented middleware to manage access control and secure API endpoints. This ensures only authorized users and experts can access sensitive data, reinforcing security and trust.

### **4. Form Requests for Validation**
Centralized validation logic using Laravel's form requests. This promotes reusability and keeps controllers clean, ensuring robust input validation for secure and reliable operations.


### **5. Dependency Injection with Service Containers**
Utilized Laravel's service container to implement dependency injection. This allows for clean management of services and dependencies, such as CRUD operations in service classes.

### **6. Database Migrations and Seeding**
Managed schema evolution through migrations and seeded the database with test data. This allows smooth development and deployment processes while maintaining data integrity.

### **7. Eloquent Relationships**
Leveraged Laravel's Eloquent ORM to define relationships between models, enabling efficient querying and minimizing database overhead. This simplifies handling complex data structures, such as user-expert interactions and test details.

### **8. Error and Exception Handling**
Implemented comprehensive error handling, returning user-friendly messages for invalid requests while logging details for debugging. This approach enhances the user experience and simplifies issue resolution.
